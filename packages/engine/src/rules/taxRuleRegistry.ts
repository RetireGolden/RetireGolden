/**
 * The tax rule registry.
 *
 * Every statutory rule this engine implements is recorded here with the
 * authority it rests on, the reading we took, and the date that reading was last
 * verified against primary sources. The registry is the single answer to "why
 * are we calculating it this way" — for a test, for a reviewer, for a report,
 * and for an advisor defending a number to a CPA.
 *
 * Three properties make that work:
 *
 * 1. It is typed and frozen, so `TaxRuleId` is a closed union and the compiler
 *    rejects a reference to a rule that does not exist. This follows the same
 *    pattern as `ACTION_REASON_REGISTRY`.
 * 2. It is data rather than prose, so tests, the planner, and reports read the
 *    same records. A generated document cannot drift from the code.
 * 3. Every `settled` rule must be covered by a fixture that discriminates
 *    between candidate readings. See `describeRule` in the test support module;
 *    conformance is asserted by `taxRuleRegistry.conformance.test.ts`.
 *
 * Adding a rule means doing the primary-source research first. A record whose
 * `authority` is thin is worse than no record, because it lends unearned
 * confidence to a guess.

      'The six-calendar-months sentence survives, but only in a provision written for something else: T.D. 10001 removed it from Treas. Reg. 1.401(a)(9)-2 and it now sits in 1.401(a)(9)-6(g)(1)(iv), a defined-benefit actuarial-increase rule. It has also been dropped from current IRS publications and survives there only in Publication 575 (2019). So the convention is sourced, but not from any provision addressed to IRC 408(d)(8)(B)(ii). What no source resolves at any level is a month-end or leap-day birth: no IRS guidance, ruling, case, publication example, or practitioner source addresses what "six calendar months after" means when the target day does not exist. The month-end clamp is chosen because it matches 29 CFR 4000.43, the one federal regulation resolving this class of problem, and because it is the prevailing practitioner convention. That regulation governs PBGC filings under ERISA Title IV and the IRS has never adopted it here, so the clamp is an engineering convention and not a legal conclusion. It errs permissive: for an August 31 birth it falls up to three days before a roll-forward reading, and a QCD taken in that window would not be a QCD at all. The date is load-bearing twice, because the SECURE 1.0 offset in 408(d)(8)(A) also keys the sweep of section 219 deductions to it.',
