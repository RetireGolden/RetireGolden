Make the FI crossing strict, so equality at the threshold does not count.

The capture also carries this file's pre-existing `projection-summary-estate-heir-tax` failure (the engine's 56,320.00 against the worksheet's 61,600.00). That failure is present on unmutated production and is not caused by this mutation.

## Command

```
NO_COLOR=1 FORCE_COLOR=0 node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/projection/compareSummary.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time and duration lines were removed. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

`git checkout -- packages/engine/src/projection/compare.ts` restored the exact original bytes (compared byte for byte in the harness), and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/projection/compare.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the named file returned to its baseline state (exit 1): the only failure is the disclosed `projection-summary-estate-heir-tax` discrepancy, which fails on unmutated production because the worksheet and the engine disagree about whether the charity fraction reduces the heir-taxed base (worksheet 61,600.00, engine 56,320.00).
