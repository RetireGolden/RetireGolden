# Mutation receipt: spending-required-requested-annual

Executed 2026-09-18 on branch `claude/b1-p4-cards-slice-nine` at base `39f8f460`, and re-executed 2026-09-22 against RetireGolden base `4fe87f00` (branch `claude/b1-p4-cards-nine-ten`, pull request #729) in `packages/engine`.

## Mutation applied to `packages/engine/src/projection/internal/annualExpenseSummary.ts`

```diff
@@ -84,7 +84,7 @@ export function annualExpenseSummary(
     careCost: input.careCost,
     ltcBenefit: input.ltcBenefit,
     requiredSpending:
-      requiredSpendingBase + input.skippedRequiredNominal,
+      requiredSpendingBase,
     targetSpending:
       targetSpendingBase +
       input.skippedTargetNominal +
```

This omits the skipped required goal, publishing $44,500 — the worksheet's first wrong reading. The target and intended fixtures in the same file fail alongside, because both carry the required base.

## Command

```
NO_COLOR=1 FORCE_COLOR=0 node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/projection/internal/annualExpenseSummary.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Re-executed 2026-09-22 on the pull-request branch after the review of #729: the branch was renamed for the pull request and several fixtures changed, so every capture, blob hash and revert note is refreshed against this head. The baseline is green (annualExpenseSummary.evidence.test.ts passes on unmodified production, exit 0). Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time and duration lines were removed. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

The original bytes of `packages/engine/src/projection/internal/annualExpenseSummary.ts` were written back and compared byte for byte in the harness, and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/projection/internal/annualExpenseSummary.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the suite returned to its baseline state, green (exit 0).
