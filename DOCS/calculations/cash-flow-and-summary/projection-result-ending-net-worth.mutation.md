This substitutes ending investable for net worth, publishing $486,375.625 — the worksheet's second wrong reading.

## Command

```
NO_COLOR=1 FORCE_COLOR=0 node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/projection/simulate.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Re-executed after merging origin/main 4d2d9d67 into this branch, which moved the hunk. The baseline is green (simulate.evidence.test.ts passes on unmodified production, exit 0). Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time, duration and module-transform timing lines were removed. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

The original bytes of `packages/engine/src/projection/simulate.ts` were written back and compared byte for byte in the harness, and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/projection/simulate.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the suite returned to its baseline state, green (exit 0).
