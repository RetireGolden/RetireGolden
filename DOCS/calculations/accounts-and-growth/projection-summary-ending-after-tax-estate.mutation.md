Ignore the charity carve-out when netting the estate.

## Command

```
NO_COLOR=1 FORCE_COLOR=0 node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/projection/compareSummary.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Re-executed because the round-one review of #765 moved the production lines or the evidence test lines this receipt quotes; the mutation is unchanged. The baseline is green (compareSummary.evidence.test.ts passes on unmodified production, exit 0). Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time, duration and module-transform timing lines were removed, and the checkout's path is written from the repository root. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

The original bytes of `packages/engine/src/projection/compare.ts` were written back and compared byte for byte in the harness, and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/projection/compare.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the suite returned to its baseline state, green (exit 0).
