Gives the successful paths a `null` bucket of their own — the worksheet's first wrong reading. It is written at the return site so `depletionProbabilityByYear`, which is derived earlier from the grouped rows, is left alone and only this record's block fails.

## Command

From `packages/engine` (the `npx` and `.cmd` shims do not work in this worktree):

```
NO_COLOR=1 FORCE_COLOR=0 node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run src/montecarlo/run.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Re-executed 2026-09-27 after merging RetireGolden #751 into B2-P1 slice 2: the drift check #751 adds flagged this receipt against the slice's code (a hunk header naming a line the code has moved from, a context line the slice changed, a header naming no line, or a stated test count the slice's evidence file no longer has), so the diff header, capture, blob hash and revert note are refreshed against this head. The baseline is green (run.evidence.test.ts passes on unmodified production, exit 0). Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time, duration and module-transform timing lines were removed. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

The original bytes of `packages/engine/src/montecarlo/run.ts` were written back and compared byte for byte in the harness, and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/montecarlo/run.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the suite returned to its baseline state, green (exit 0).
