Replace the real-yield catalog ID with a different ID, violating the enumerated dataset identity.

## Command

```
npx.cmd vitest run src/params/provenance.evidence.test.ts
```

## Captured failing output

Re-executed after the PR #759 review fixes: a non-finite age now throws first in sampleDeathAge, jointLastSurvivorExpectancy and hazardForExpectancyMultiplier (review 5), the table module gained the known editions and the published curve gap (reviews 7 and 8), and the provenance catalog gained the 2022 edition (review 1), which moved the lines, test titles and counts these receipts quote. The baseline is green (provenance.evidence.test.ts passes on unmodified production, exit 0). Captured with `NO_COLOR=1` and `FORCE_COLOR=0`; stdout precedes stderr. Start time, duration and module-transform timing lines were removed. Exit code: 1.

## Revert

The original bytes of `packages/engine/src/params/provenance.ts` were written back and compared byte for byte in the harness, and `git diff --quiet -- packages/engine/src/params/provenance.ts` then exited 0, confirming no production change remained. Re-ran the named command after restoration: the suite returned to its baseline state, green (exit 0).
